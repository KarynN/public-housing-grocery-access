			<p>Currently there are 3936 grocery stores in NYC.<br><br>A community’s standard of living is directly related to the quality and quantity of resources available to them. Community health outcomes depend on the nutritional resources available to every individual. To protect citizens’ health, we must identify and rectify the systemic behaviors which contribute to nutritional inequity.<br><br>What does nutritional accessibility look like in NYC?<br><br><span style = "font-size: 11px;"><br>Data from Reference USA downloaded November 2020</span></p>
		</div>
		<div id="div3">
			<p>Specifically, we focused on the <a href="https://www1.nyc.gov/assets/nycha/downloads/pdf/NYCHA-Fact-Sheet_2019_08-01.pdf">564,301 people</a> living in the 302 public housing developments that currently exist in NYC.<br><br><span style = "font-size: 11px;"><br>Data from NYC Open Data</span></p>
		</div>
		<div id="div4">
			<p>In order to interpret accessibility, we calculated the distance to every grocery store within a 30 minute walk radius of every public housing development.<br><br>We then used this data to count the number of grocery stores that can be reached in 30 minutes as well as 10 minutes.
			</p>
		</div>
		<div id="div5">
			<p>This public housing development in Lower East Side, Manhattan has access to:<br><br>20 grocery stores within a 10 minute walk<br><br>134 grocery stores within a 30 minute walk</p>
		</div>
		<div id="div6">
			<p>This public housing development in Dongan Hills, Staten Island has access to:<br><br>0 grocery stores within a 30 minute walk</p>
		</div>

			<p>Graph?</p>
		</div>
		<div id="div8">
			<p>In order to compare access among public housing developments, we looked at both the number of grocery stores that exist within the 10 minute radius as well as the travel times to all grocery stores within the 30 minute radius.<br><br>The percentile on the 10 Minutes map is derived from the number of grocery stores that can be accessed in 10 minutes<br><br>The score on the 30 Minutes map is calculated by weighting all of the grocery stores that can be reached in 30 minutes. Grocery stores that are under 10 minutes away are given a weight of 1 while stores that are 10-30 minutes away are weighted on a linearly decreasing scale. This score is normalized to a 0-100 scale.<br><br>The circles are colored according to percentile/score with darker colors indicating a higher percentile/score.<br><br><span style = "font-size: 11px">click on circles for more information</span></p>

			<p><span style = "text-decoration:underline;">What's Missing?</span><br><br>In reducing geometries to points, we lose the ability to consider a housing development’s size while calculating our iso-areas. As a specific example, the Breukelen Houses in Brooklyn have a total area of 2,830,416 square feet which mostly covers the ten minute radius.<br><br>By focusing on time measurements, we inherently ignore factors such as store pricing and sales volume, which are important considerations for accurately describing nutritional access.<br><br>Our analysis investigates the presence of disparate grocery store access, but does not offer suﬀicient quantitative insight towards promoting nutritional equity. As presented, it is not entirely clear as to whether housing developments or grocery stores (or both) have been misplaced or “misplanned.”</p>
		</div>
		<div id="div10">
			<p><span style = "text-decoration:underline;">What's Next?</span><br><br>To provide a more comprehensive analysis, we would like to investigate which demographic factors are correlated with nutritional access.  Specifically, we would like to consider census geometries and American Community Survey demographic estimates. Using classification methods such as logistic regression would allow us to determine how factors such as average income, age, and race correlate with nutritional access.<br><br>In addition to extending our numerical interpretation of accessibility, we would also like to better understand the behaviors of interaction between citizens and grocery stores to identify which characteristics of a grocery store define its impact on local nutrition access.<br><br>This further inquiry would entail researching the mechanics of grocery supply chains, economic evolution of American cities, and how multinational corporations influence or disrupt nutrition accesibility in different communities. We can pair this literature review with a regression analysis which relates store traﬀic to certain features such as sales volume and employee count.<br><br>By enhancing our understanding of the interaction between people and grocery stores, we can perform a more informed quantitive investigation of nutritional access, and identify demographic trends and causal behaviors.</p>
